# TTSbot
This read me is going to have kinda bad formatting, sorry. So I wanted to make a version of my discord bot public for all the other mute/nonverbal/seclectively mute/etc. people out there! For ease of use all you have to do to get it running is change id.txt and give it the file path for ffmpeg.

Theres a bunch of guides online for how to find your bots token/make one, but heres one that I quickly googled: https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/

Also you'll need to grab the dependencies on your own

For anyone who wants it to do more I threw an extra (literally called extra.py) file in there with some basic commands to at least minimize the amount you're on the discord docs which are woefully unhelpful in sections

Also big apologies to anyone on a linux distro but this doesn't work on there, I'm looking at making another version (as an Arch user I know the pain of not having something run, I just host my bot on a windows machine and this is mostly just repurposed code)

Also I do have a JS version but thats not done because JS isn't my favorite thing to work on and discord.js is also kinda stinky

As for way I made this in the first place:

1.I wanted to know what I said wasn't being tracked by the bot itself or anything someone posted in a server with it

2.I wanted to add fun stuff to my own bot

3.Discords default tts services are really awful and they don't really catch any flack for that

(also sorry for any spelling or grammatical errors throughout this, I threw it together from my bots code in like an hours lmao)
